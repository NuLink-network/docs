# NuLink for Stakers

Stakers are essential contributors to the NuLink network, supporting decentralized infrastructure and providing valuable services. This guide will walk you through the staking process, detail the roles available, and explain the reward and fee structures.

In the NuLink network, there are two types of stakers: grid maintainers and standard stakers.

- **Grid Maintainers:** Grid maintainers operate a grid by running a worker node connected to the network, playing a key role in ensuring stability and maintenance. In return, they earn two types of rewards: a Service Bonus from the network and a delegation fee from standard stakers who delegate their tokens to the grid.

- **Standard Stakers:** Standard stakers do not need to run a node. Instead, they choose a grid to stake with, delegating their tokens to a grid maintainer. In return, they receive rewards from the grid, with a portion allocated to the grid maintainer based on the grid's predefined fee rate.

This guide will help you understand each role and make the most of your staking experience in the NuLink network.

## Staking Dashboard

[NuLink Staking Dashboard](https://dashboard.testnet.nulink.org) is a user-friendly interface designed to empower stakers in managing their staking activities. Key features include:

- **Stake Statistics**: Provides a clear overview of staking metrics and performance.
- **Grid Auction and Management**: Allows users to participate in grid auctions and manage grid settings.
- **Stake Management**: Simplifies the process of staking, unstaking, and tracking rewards.
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Facilitates token transfers across different blockchain networks, enhancing flexibility for stakers.

This dashboard streamlines staking and grid management, making it accessible for all types of participants in the NuLink network. Learn more about the [NuLink Staking Dashboard](./staker/dashboardoverall.md).

## NuLink Worker Installer

The [**NuLink Worker Installer**](./staker/nulink_worker.md) simplifies the deployment of NuLink worker nodes, enabling stakers to contribute computing resources to the NuLink network efficiently. The installation process involves:

1. [**Creating Worker Account:**](./staker/eth_account.md) Stakers need to create a dedicated worker account to manage their worker node.
2. [**Worker Installation:**](./staker/worker_install.md) Detailed instructions on installing the NuLink worker on the staker's infrastructure.
3. [**Initialization and Running:**](./staker/worker_running.md) Guidance on initializing and running the NuLink worker node for optimal performance.
4. [**Worker Update:**](./staker/worker_update.md) Information on updating the NuLink worker to the latest version for access to new features and improvements.


Explore the [NuLink Worker Installer](./staker/nulink_worker.md) for step-by-step instructions.


**Warning:** Do not use same address for staker account and worker account.
