This page displays detailed information about your staking in the selected slot, including principal, staking rewards, etc.
The key difference between `MY STAKING IN POOL` and `PENDING STAKING AMOUNT` is that `MY STAKING IN POOL` represents the amount that has already taken effect during the current epoch, while `PENDING STAKING AMOUNT` represents the amount staked during the current epoch, which will take effect in the next epoch.


### Stake

Click `STAKE` to stake your NLK, as shown below:

You can manually enter the amount you wish to stake or click `MAX` to input your entire balance. 
After confirming the amount, click `STAKE`, which will trigger a pop-up to confirm the staking details, including the start of interest accrual and the time of withdrawal. 
Click `YES, Iâ€™M SURE` to trigger the wallet for gas fee payment. Once paid, the staking is successful.


### Unstake

There are two types of unstaking: `UNSTAKE AMOUNT FROM POOL` and `UNSTAKE`, as shown below:

* `UNSTAKE AMOUNT FROM POOL` will allow you to withdraw your principal after the current epoch ends.
* `UNSTAKE` will allow you to withdraw pending principal immediately.

### Claim Rewards

Interest is generated after each epoch ends. 
The interest will be settled and added to `MY CLAIMABLE REWARDS`. 
Users can then `CLAIM REWARDS` to transfer the interest to their wallet, as shown below:
