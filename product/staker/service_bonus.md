Currently, only BSC is supported, and other chains will gradually become available.

## Service bonus distribution

Scrolling further, you will see the `Service Bonus Distribution` section. 
Only users who have installed a Stake Grid and bound it to a worker are eligible to receive service bonuses. 
The distribution of 80% of the service bonus from each batch is based on each user’s Reputation Score Quota (the Reputation Score is related to the uptime of the node—the higher the uptime, the higher the score).
