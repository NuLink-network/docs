# NuLink Worker Installation

NuLink worker node can be run from a docker container. 

## Docker install and update

1. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)
2. Pull the latest NuLink image.
    ```shell
    docker pull nulink/nulink:latest
    ```

3. Create a directory in your host machine for later usage.
    ```shell
    cd /root
    
    mkdir nulink
    ```

4. Copy the keystore file of the Worker account to the host directory selected in step 3. The private file generated by NuLink Worker will also be stored in this directory.
   ```shell
   cp /root/geth-linux-amd64-1.10.23-d901d853/keystore/* /root/nulink
   ```
   **Please ensure that this directory has 777 permissions**:
   ```shell
   chmod -R 777 /root/nulink
   ```
